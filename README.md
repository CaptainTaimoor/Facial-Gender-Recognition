Gender Detection using Haar Cascade and Machine Learning

In this code, I address the problem of gender detection using a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately determine the gender of individuals from facial images. The pipeline includes image preprocessing, feature extraction using the Haar Cascade classifier, and training various machine learning models to achieve accurate gender predictions.

Data Preparation and Preprocessing

The code begins by loading and preprocessing facial images from gender-specific folders using the Haar Cascade classifier. The images are converted to grayscale and then subjected to face detection using the pre-trained Haar Cascade model. Detected faces are resized to a uniform image dimension to ensure consistency across the dataset. Extracted face images are flattened to create feature vectors and paired with corresponding gender labels.

Data Exploration and Visualization

The script provides insights into the dataset by displaying a set of randomly selected male and female face images. This visualization offers a glimpse of the data being used for training and testing the models. It helps us understand the diversity and quality of the dataset.

Model Selection and Evaluation

The code introduces several machine learning classifiers for gender prediction, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. For each classifier, the script trains the model on the pre-processed data and evaluates its performance using accuracy. Additionally, the training time for each model is measured to assess computational efficiency.

Results Visualization

The code produces two bar graphs that visualize the results of the trained classifiers. The first graph displays the accuracy achieved by each model, providing insights into their predictive performance. The second graph illustrates the training time required for each classifier, offering a comparison of computational efficiency among different models.

Conclusion

This code showcases a comprehensive approach to gender detection from facial images. By combining image processing techniques with machine learning algorithms, it demonstrates how to preprocess data, extract meaningful features, train models, and evaluate their performance. The visualizations and results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of different classifiers, aiding in the selection of the most suitable model for gender detection tasks.
